# vue-side-nav

for the best user-experience when navigating your side, you can use a responsive side-nav.

### [Demo](https://vue-comps.github.io/vue-side-nav)


# Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev vue-side-nav vue-touch
```
or include `build/bundle.js`.

## Usage
```coffee
# somewhere
Vue.use(require('vue-touch'))

# in your component
components:
  "side-nav": require("vue-side-nav")
# or, when using bundle.js
components:
  "side-nav": window.vueComps.sideNav
```
```html
<side-nav>
  <li>First Text<li>
</side-nav>
<!-- silbling elements will be set to margin-left:240px for `fixed` and `is-fixed=true` -->
<container>
</container>
```
For examples see [`dev/`](dev/).

#### Props

#### Events
Name |  description

before-leave |  will be called before close animation

#### Transition

You can provide a vue transition like this:
```js
Velocity = require("velocity-animate")

template: "<modal transition='moveIn'></modal>",
methods:{
  moveIn: function ({el,style,cb}) {
    Velocity el, "stop"
    Velocity el, style, {
      duration: 300,
      queue: false,
      easing: 'easeOutQuad',
      complete: cb
    }
  }
}
```

The background is managed by `vue-overlay`.
See [here](https://github.com/vue-comps/vue-overlay#overlayfadeelopacitycb) for an example on how to change its fading function.
